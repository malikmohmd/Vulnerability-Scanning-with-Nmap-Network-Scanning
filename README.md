## 1. Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap: Network Scanning

### Objective
The goal of this project was to perform vulnerability scanning using Nmap, identifying open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities to assess the security posture of network systems.

### Skills Learned
- Network scanning fundamentals and techniques.
- Proficiency with Nmap commands.
- Service and version detection for vulnerability identification.
- Conducting vulnerability assessments.

### Tools Used
- **Nmap**: Network scanning and vulnerability detection tool.
- **Virtual Machine (VM)**: Used for testing scans in a simulated environment.

### Steps Involved
1. **Setup**: Installed Nmap and configured a virtual network environment.
2. **Basic Scanning**: Conducted network scans to identify live hosts and open ports.
3. **Service Detection**: Used `-sV` command to detect services and versions.
4. **OS Fingerprinting**: Implemented `-O` command for operating system detection.
5. **Advanced Scanning**: Used aggressive scanning (`-A`) for detailed information gathering.

### Conclusion
This project provided a strong foundation in network vulnerability scanning. By using Nmap, I learned how to identify potential risks in network configurations, which is critical for proactive security assessments. The skills gained will be beneficial for future roles in network security and vulnerability management.
